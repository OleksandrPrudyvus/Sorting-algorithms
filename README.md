# Sorting-algorithms
In this project, a detailed analysis of sorting algorithms was performed. 
The time complexity of each algorithm was determined and graphs of time dependence on input data were created to objectively assess the sweetness of the algorithm.
List of analyzed algorithms:
- Sort Choice
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Merge Sort



At the moment, it is planned to expand the analyzed algorithms to 10.
As well as to conduct an analysis of the speed between each algorithm and present all the data in the table.
